I started my new job at Google in December 2010, ten years after I rejected
their first offer. After actually experiencing the day to day life of a
researcher, I was now going full circle to an engineering position, the very
same role I snubbed for so many years. A few words of explanation are in order:
why now, what had changed? Many things, but most importantly my own
attitude. You see, throughout college and graduate school I had been conditioned
to value "science" above "mere engineering". Coding was something I picked
up early, on my ZX Spectrum back in the eighties, and it felt easy; research, on
the other hand, was actually hard, and writing and endlessly rewriting
conference papers was harder. 

I was confusing difficulty with value. On honest reflection, a lot of the
research I was involved in was not very impactful: it led to conference
publications and patents, all right, but how many of those ideas actually made
it into actual products that people used? Not many. You see, I had this nagging
feeling that my effort was largely irrelevant, removed as I was from production.

This was what made the Google offer so attractive: I was finally going to
directly contribute to a product used every day by so many people.

And Google understood how to curate an exciting and fun on-boarding experience
for the new hires, which in turn allowed people to become productive faster. Let
me explain: on the first day we were given a tour of the office, complete with
gourmet breakfast and coffee, and for the first two weeks we had no work
assignments, other than attending classes on the Google internal systems, such
as "Life of a Google Query" (a high-level systems view of query processing),
"Life of a Dollar" (an overview of Google Ads), "Your first Change List" (how to
use the Google internal source control system), "Word count with MapReduce" (how
to use the massively parallel computing environment to process large amounts of
data quickly), "Borg" (the internal cloud infrastructure), and others like
these.  It really felt like we were briefed on a highly advanced software
engineering wonderland, because that's exactly what this was! Everything was
carefully designed for maximum effect, from the playfully colored interior
design and the free food and gourmet coffee, to the design of the internal
websites we used every day. The internal classes didn't end after the first two
weeks, there were lots more hands-on "labs" available on the intranet, each one
of them personalized for each engineer, already configured to work
out-of-the-box with one's work account. 

But the thing that shocked me the most was the availability of seemingly
unlimited computing resources. Let me explain. For my starter project I was
assigned a new feature for an experimental question-answering system. The system
was designed to provide short answers to factual entity-attribute type
questions, like "What is the height of the Empire State Building?". My task was
to extend this system to also handle questions where the answer was a list, like
"What is the cast of Casablanca?". In order to do that, I had to implement a
program to extract lists from the Web and associate them with
entity-attribute pairs (eg. Casablanca-cast). I implemented a first solution
using what I had just learned from the introductory MapReduce class and it was time to
test it. I asked a teammate if I can test it on some sample data, and he looked
at me surprised and said: 

"Why bother with sample data, just run it on the whole Web corpus.".

"Wouldn't that take a long time?", I asked. 

"No, just submit it to Borg and ask for 5,000 machines. It will be done in an
hour or so."

I could not believe it! At any other previous job, including IBM, I would need
to have a good reason to request access to a cluster of 10 servers, most of my
work was done on a single machine. Here, I could request 5,000 machines just
like that, and process the whole Web in an hour! It was amazing.

Now, that's not to say it was easy getting things done. I had not been a
professional software engineer for over 15 years now, all the coding I've done
lately was for research prototypes, working mostly on my own. Here, all the code
had to go through peer review before it could be committed into the
repository. For new hires, there was an additional "readability review", in
addition to the regular code review. To be approved, every code change I made
had to conform to the internal style guidelines, and be reviewed by an engineer
who had "readability certification" for that specific programming language. A
new hire could only apply for that certification after writing some substantial
amount of original code in that language. The justification that was often
invoked was that "source code is read by a computer only once, but it is read by humans many times". 

And the senior engineers were dead serious on not approving anything until it
was perfectly designed and thoroughly tested. As you can imagine, this slowed me
down significantly. I had my first results relatively quickly but I couldn't
merge my code for weeks. Meanwhile, the code around my pieces would change, and
I had to constantly readjust my own code to fit the new structures.

Finally, after about six months my new feature was ready to launch! I cannot
express in words the joy I experienced when I typed my first query on my
Android phone "Who are the four Beatles?" on google.com and I saw the results
prominently shown on the top of the results page!

After that initial launch euphoria passed though, I was confronted with an unexpected bump in the road: my manager told me that the level I had been hired at was provisional, as all new hires need to go through a “leveling process” which is the same as a regular promotion process. That meant that a promotion committee had to review my Google accomplishments to date and reach a decision. This being Google, the promotion committee consisted of engineers outside of our department, who had to review and rank hundreds of promotion packages for people they didn’t interact with, solely based on their files. This was intentionally designed this way in an effort to reduce bias. “Alright, sounds good to me, even though the recruiter didn’t mention anything about that.” It may have been buried in some fine print in my hiring contract, but who reads the fine print? Regardless, my manager prepared my “promotion package”, submitted it to the committee, and a few weeks later the decision came: “Insufficient evidence of impact”. My manager said he was going to appeal the decision. 

The next morning, after my regular two-hour commute by car, Metro North train, and two subway trains, I got to my desk in a bad mood: what did they mean “insufficient”? I was in no condition to work, I couldn’t face my colleagues, I felt like they were all judging me (they had no idea, of course, it was all in my head). On an impulse, I went on the intranet and submitted a vacation request for one day, and left. Now my teammates looked surprised, but I mumbled something about not feeling well and walked out. It was a sunny June day, and I started walking around Manhattan, my thoughts racing: had I made a mistake leaving a well-established and respected position at IBM? No, definitely no: I was not challenged there. Yes, it was comfortable and prestigious, but it was lacking the feedback loop of seeing your code running in production and measuring its impact in real time. At IBM we were just talking about key performance indicators, here I was seeing them in action. So after a while I calmed down and focused on enjoying the city, making the best of my day off. I called Grațiela and told her what I’m doing and promised to be home early. She understood perfectly what I was going through and encouraged me to just take all the time I needed, no need to rush home. 

The next morning I was back in the office, this time with a clear head, and went back to work. Not too long after, my level was confirmed, my manager’s appeal had worked. By then I had already realized that it didn’t actually matter: our experimental question answering system was going to be turned into a prominent feature and launched on the desktop version too (it was only available on mobile initially). 

“We are going to join the big leagues now”, I remember our Technical Lead announcing, “we need to make our system production-ready, including our deployment, monitoring and alerting systems. We also need to set up an on-call rotation.”

Exciting times! Scary, but exciting. I remember watching the memory usage graphs and noticing how they were trending upwards over several days: our code had a memory leak somewhere. Luckily we also had the profiling tools to narrow down the list of suspects. It didn’t take long and the bug was found and fixed. Phew, we could now sleep without fear of getting paged at night!

Another year had passed. In the meantime we started working with another team from the Mountain View office who had developed a research prototype for scoring answer candidates using signals from the surrounding text. Our TL realized we could benefit from combining their score with ours by using what is known as an “ensemble system”. Curious about the contribution of each scoring system I ran an analysis on our internal benchmark of factual short-answer queries. The results were striking: their system alone was close to the combined performance, ours was not. It was still better to use both in the ensemble but it was clear which one was better. 

Everything was going great, except the commute: I had tried all the combinations of car, train, subway, buses and every single one was taking about two hours each way and was just as exhausting. I remember the precise moment when I decided this wasn’t sustainable: I had just gotten off the train in the White Plains station, walking in the dark to my car. We had to move! And if we were going to move, let’s move to California and escape the winter too!
