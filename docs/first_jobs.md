I remember our first day at the Research Institute for Informatics: we were
asked to pick a research group to join. I was at a loss: so far all my research
was purely theoretical, using algebraic objects to describe the structure of
flowcharts. Nobody was working on anything remotely related to that in the
institute, they were mostly focused on more traditional areas like Operating
Systems, Compilers, Networks, and Information Systems. That's when Dana said: 

"George, how about Databases? Every application needs to persist state somehow,
you'll always be in demand. It's not Abstract Algebra, but it's useful. And I
heard that it has a theoretical side to it too. That's what I'm picking."

At that point, I knew next to nothing about databases, only that I tried and
failed to convert the CS library catalog into a searchable database, as a school
project. I had never seen a commercial database system ever. I heard of a thing
called Oracle, but I don't think it was installed on our school mainframe, and
even if it was, us students didn't have access to it. However, Dana's arguments
resonated with me, after spending the past couple of years wondering whether my
work could have any possible applications, I was attracted by the idea of
working in a more applied area. So we went together to talk to the manager of
the Database Research group. I don't know what kind of vibe we were giving,
because, after he listened to us he said:

"It's great that you're interested in this area, there are a lot of interesting
problems to solve. I do have one thing I want to warn the two of you about,
though: are you sure you want to work in the same team and see each other all
the time at work too?"

It took us a second to process his question, and then we answered in unison:

"Oh, we're not married!"

"Oh, sorry", said the manager, slightly confused, "in that case, welcome to our
team!"

So we joined the Database Research group and got assigned seats in their lab
right away.  There was however no on-boarding, no mentorship, and no oversight to
our work. I think I did less work there than ever before and nobody was really
interested. It was quite a letdown after all the hard classes and the
undergraduate research I did. I kept busy implementing side projects for fun on
the work PC, and getting used to the newest peripheral, the mouse, of course in
text mode, but still a great improvement over arrow keys. I left that job after
about six months. Dana left around the same time too: she had applied for
graduate school in France, and had obtained a scholarship at the famous École
Normale Supérieure in Paris.

My next job was in a startup called Omnis Group. This is where I first saw a
graphical operating system, the new Microsoft Windows 3.1, in 1991. I learned
how to write programs for Windows from the Charles Petzold book, Programming
Windows. At the time, the programs were single threaded, and the book taught us
to write event handlers that returned control quickly because otherwise the
operating system would be frozen. These were interactive programs: a user would
push a button on the UI, or select a menu item, something needed to happen in
response, and then the program would wait for the next user interaction. So I
used this paradigm to implement some sort of accounting application for a
Belgian oil refinery that was backed by a network database called dbVista.

There were tools for designing the GUI visually and converting it to runnable
assets accessible from C code. I also started learning C++ there, from Bjarne
Stroustrup’s book. I needed that for the next project, a research GUI for
analyzing proteins. There were some edge-detection algorithms there, but I don’t
remember much about that project other than the fact we were using graphical
workstations running X11 and the mice were optical with a special mouse pad with
a grid on it. I also had my first contact there with running remote sessions
over the LAN on my colleagues' workstations. We were playing pranks on each
other by opening windows on someone else’s screen. It was there I first heard of
telnet and ftp. No email just yet, since our LAN was not permanently connected
to any external network. There was an occasional connection through a modem and
a leased telephone line, I heard, but that wasn’t part of my day-to-day work.

After working there and being a teaching assistant at the University
at the same time for a couple of years, I left my job at Omnis Group
thinking I could focus on my teaching job at the University. I was
wrong. My in-laws started to ask me to run errands for them the moment
I was out from my full-time job: I apparently had too much time on my
hands. I clearly needed another full-time job, and fast. Hearing me
say that, our old friend Claudia offered to talk to her boss about
me. She was a salesperson at the Romanian branch of Ciel!, a French
accounting software company. And wouldn't you know it, he called me
for an interview the very next week! On the appointed day I went to
their office in the Bucharest Hotel, remembering how I had carried
bricks when the hotel was being built during my high school mandatory
"volunteering" weeks (we were all taken out of regular classes for two
weeks to work on various construction sites each year).

Anyway, I got to the manager's office and he showed me the company
software suite on his PC. It was a comprehensive set of accounting
applications they were adapting for the Romanian small businesses, all
running in text mode, with drop down menus and text-based input
forms. I looked at him and said: "This is good, but nowadays the
competition has modern GUIs running inside Microsoft Windows. Give me
six months and I will rewrite one of these applications completely
from scratch in Windows, as a proof of concept." He hired me on the
spot.

There I worked on porting to Windows an old text-mode Clipper
accounting application called “Ciel! Dossiers Analytiques”. One
thing I remember about that was the trouble caused by rounding for
accounting applications, where the monetary amounts had to match
precisely, down to cents.

I remember there was this constant friendly teasing between the
software people and the sales people about who's contribution was more
important: of course we were arguing that without us, there would be
nothing to sell, but Claudia was pointing out that our software would
be worthless if she and her peers didn't get the customers to pay for
the license. She had a point!
